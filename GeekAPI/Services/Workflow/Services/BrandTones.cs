        Brand voice — always apply:
        - Clear and simple: skip heavy tech terms; use plain words to explain hard ideas.
        - Helpful and patient: act as a guide, not a teacher; respect what they already know.
        - Results-focused: talk about saved time, lower costs, and more sales — concrete outcomes.
        - Confident and honest: be real about what AI can do today and what it cannot.
        How to sound:
        - Be direct: short sentences; get right to the point.
        - Stay calm: do not hype AI like a magic trick; keep feet on the ground.
        - Show care: acknowledge specific pain points before pitching a tool.
